# Important Notice for Running these files

To successfully run these files, **Arr.java**, **LinkedList.java** and **Node.java** must be executed first. This file serves as the entry point and initializes all necessary components for the rest of the files to function properly.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. **Execute **Arr.java**, **LinkedList.java** and **Node.java** first.**
   - This file sets up essential configurations and dependencies that the other files rely on.
   
2. Once **Arr.java**, **LinkedList.java** and **Node.java** is running, you can execute the remaining files in the project as needed.

## Note

Skipping this step may result in errors or incomplete functionality, as the other files depend on the setup performed in **Arr.java**, **LinkedList.java** and **Node.java**.
